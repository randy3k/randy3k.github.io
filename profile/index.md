I learned writing webpages, `php`, `mysql` in secondary school.  While I am
using `R` everyday, I also write `python`, `julia` and `c` codes. Moreover, I
have great interests in web development such as `coffeescript` and `node.js`.
Currently, I fall in love with the amazing editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). 
If I have more time, I would also like to learn `ruby`, `java`, `go` and many others...
